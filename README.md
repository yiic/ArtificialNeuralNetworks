# Artificial Neural Networks Implementations
- Built artificial neural networks in C++. Trained and tested a convolutional neural network model with MNIST dataset and achieved 96.4% accuracy.
- Trained a dynamical system model which consists of a generative neural network with unsupervised learning and a neural network with supervised learning. This model is able to generate images of a crane system that moves with two degrees of freedom.
