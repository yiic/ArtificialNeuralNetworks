# Artificial Neural Networks Implementations
- Linear Regression (house price prediction)
- Artificial Neural Networks (more hidden units, used both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent)
- Converlutional Neural Networks (trained and tested with MNIST dataset and achieved 96.4% accuracy.)
- L1 and L2 Regulations (Comparisons shown in RegulationsChart.png)
- Dynamical System (the dynamical system consists of a generative neural network with unsupervised learning and a neural network with supervised learning. This model is able to generate images of a crane system that moves with two degrees of freedom.)
